After this, you can try and use the `./test/index.js` file. Before running it, you will need to configure two cookies.

To get your cookies (free), follow these steps:
- Go to https://heypi.com/talk (no need to register)
- Open your developer tools using <kbd>ctrl</kbd> (or <kbd>command</kbd> if you are on mac) + <kbd>shift</kbd> + <kbd>i</kbd>.
- Then, go to your Storage (in Chrome it's called Application) tab > at the left menu, select "Cookies".
- You'll need to copy two cookies values: `__cf_bm` and `__Host-session`
- Paste your cookies like that:
```js
import HeyPi from "./src/index.js";
const pi = new HeyPi(
  "__Host-session cookie",
  "__cf_bm cookie"
);
const message = "Hello!";
await pi
  .chat(message, { returnAsJson: false })
  .then((result) => {
    console.log(result);
  })
  .catch((error) => {
    console.log("Error occurred:", error);
  });
```
- After completing these steps, you can run this code and enjoy!
